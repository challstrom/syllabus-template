  "body": " Welcome!    Prof. Hallstrom  University of Portland      Welcome! In this course you will describe relationships between changing quantities using the tools of differential and integral calculus and explore the ideas of continuity, limits, differentiation, and integration at both a theoretical level and in applied contexts. You will further develop problem-solving skills and improve mathematical communication.  You Belong Here!  In our classroom, diversity and individual differences are respected, appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. I support the use of mathematics as an analytic tool to challenge power, privilege, and oppression. It is our collective responsibility to create a welcoming space where ideas can be challenged while individuals are respected. I ask you to support one another as you develop as mathematicians and analytic thinkers.    "

  "title": "Course Content and Objectives",
  "body": " Course Content and Objectives  This course is an introduction to differential and integral calculus with an emphasis on applications in the natural and physical sciences. It is aimed at mathematics, engineering, and science majors or anyone else interested in building a foundation for further study in mathematics. Course-level learning goals include: communicating effectively about course content and solution methods; per- sistence in solving challenging, multi-step problems; reflection on one?s own learning; effective use of technology. Certain affective traits (i.e., dispositions and habits that are useful for all learners, regardless of topic) are also valued, such as persistence and growth mindset, and the development of these qualities will be fostered by the course.   University Core  Calculus at the University of Portland is a part of our liberal arts Core Curriculum with a vision of students acquiring knowledge, skills, and values that will prepare you to respond to the needs of the world and its human family, while having a foundation of multiple lenses to address enduring questions of human concern. The Core Curriculum strives to achieve this vision by cultivating six habits of heart and mind in all graduates regardless of major.  As a priority for this Core class, our focus is the scientific and quantitative literacy and problem solving habit. As part of developing that habit this course will prioritize students learning to employ mathematical and statistical skills to explore and make sense of data. Toward this end, as one specific Core learning outcome for this class, the expectation is that students who complete this course will be able to use the tools of differential calculus to solve complex problems and effectively communicate solutions in written form.   Learning Objectives  By the end of the course, you should be able to say the following (items marked with (*) are considered core objectives).  Limits    (*) I can explain the meaning of a limit beyond describing how to calculuate it.  (*) I can find one and two sided limits of a function at a point and at inifinity using numerical, graphical, and algebraic methods.  I can determine the points at which a function is (or is not) continuous and can use continuity to determine limits.  I can identify limits in indeterminate form and can apply L'Hopital's rule correctly.     Derivatives    (*) I can correcly interpret the meaning of a derivative as an instantaneous rate of change and compare it to an average rate of change both graphically and numerically.  I can find the derivative of a function (both at a point and as a function) using the limit definition of the derivative.  I can interpret teh meaning of a derivative and it's units in a variety of contexts.  (*) I can compute derivatives of polynomial and exponential functions.  (*) I can compute basic derivates using the product, quotient, and chain rules.  I can compute derivates of logarithmic, trigonometric, and inverse trig functions.  I can use techniques of implicit and logarithmic differentiation.  (*) I can compute derivates using combinations of multiple rules and strategies.     Applications    (*) I can find the equation of the tangent line to a graph of a function at a point. I can interpret the linear approximation graphically and use it to estimate function values and error.  (*) I can use information about a function and its derivatives to describe its behavior, including its concavity and the shape of its graph.  (*) I can use derivates to solve optimization problems.  I can use derivatives to solve related rate problems.     Integrals    I can calculate the area between curves, net change, and displacement using geometric methods, including Riemann sums.  I can use properities and theorems to calculate and interpret definte integrals.  (*) I can explain the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in terms of net change and displacements in graphical and applied contexts.  I can find antiderivates of a function and use them to evaluate definite integrals using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.     Connections    I can effectively communicate understand of course content using words, graphs, and notation.  I can demonstrate perseverance in solving complex and unfamiliar problems.  (*) I can evaluate the validity of statements and construct examples (or counterexamples) illustrating major concepts.  I can demonstrate a habit of consistent practice.  I can reflect on my own learning practices and use that reflection to grow as a learner.        "

  "title": "Methods of Assessment",
  "body": " Methods of Assessment  This course is guided by the philosophy that learning mathematics requires focused effort, reflection, and revision. Assessment of this course is based on a proficiency system, in which students have multiple attempts to demonstrate proficiency, with opportunities to reflect on and improve previous understanding.   Participation  You are expected to actively participate in this classroom community. This can include coming to class on time, being prepared, being willing to ask questions and share ideas, setting up study groups outside of class, attending tutoring sessions, posting helpful resources online, and contributing to the classroom virtual chat. Exit cards will be assigned regularly at the conclusion of class as part of participation assessment. Group and individual presentations of ideas is a required component of participation.  We will cover new course material on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Most Tuesday class times will be for small group work on labs and for proficiency assessment.    Homework  Regular practice is required to convert new skills into lasting, automatic procedures. For most sections, you will be required to complete an online homework via WebWork. The online homework will be due at 5:00 pm. Homework is due Monday, Wednesday, or Friday the class period after it is covered in class. Homework is graded automatically.  It is strongly suggested that you do your homework regularly; it's best done following class, when it is fresh in your mind. Most questions allow unlimited attempts and there is no penalty for incorrect answers. If you find yourself stuck on a problem after many attempts, please reach out for additional help! Late homework can earn up to half credit.    Labs  Semi-weekly labs will be due on Wednesdays at 5pm. Lab problems should be either typed or written and submitted as a pdf file in Moodle. These labs are part of the Core Assessment, and will have common grading across all MTH 201 sections. Labs will be graded on three components:  Validity:  Is the method correct? Is the final solution correct?   Explanation:  Is the solution method well explained? Is the reasonableness of the solution justified?   Representation:  Is the solution process clearly written? Is the solution supported with appropriate graphs\/diagrams\/equations? Is mathematical notation used clearly and correctly?     Labs are graded on a proficiency scale and revisions are due one week after the original due date.    Video Quizzes  Before each class, you will complete a 5-question, multiple-choice video quiz embedded in Moodle. You have two attempts and your highest attempt is recorded. To prepare for the video quiz, a 20 minute video Intro video is assigned for each section. An optional video with additional examples is posted for most sections as well.    Proficiency Quizzes  Weekly proficiency quizzes provide opportunities to demonstrate your understanding of the course learning targets. Each quiz will include 2-3 learning targets as well as the option to reassess past targets. Proficiency should be attained twice for each learning target.     Reflections  Periodically throughout the semester I will ask you to think about your process and assess your progress in the course. Reflections are a place to consider how things are going (and communicate that to me). Self-assessments are an opportunity for you to connect the skills and proficiencies that you're practicing with the course-level objectives, as well as make the case that your progress in the course warrants a particular grade.    Final Exam  Our Final Exam is scheduled for XXXX-XXXX on DATE.   "

  "title": "Assessment Standards",
  "body": " Assessment Standards  In general, your work in this class will be assessed using the following Proficiency Scale .     Grade Rubric Description    Highly Proficient: P+ Work meets or exceeds expectations. Characterized by complete and successful work on all portions of the question with thorough and correct reasoning. Mastery of the concepts is evident with at most a few minor or trivial errors.    Proficient: P Work meets or exceeds expectations. Characterized by complete and successful work on all portions of the question with thorough and correct reasoning. Mastery of the concepts is evident with at most a few minor or trivial errors.    Not Yet: NY Work does not yet meet expectations. Partial understanding is evident, but substantive gaps remain and the work needs revision.    Unable to assess: U Work is incomplete, missing, or does not address the learning target in a meaningful way.      Revisting Your Work  Much of your work in this class can be revised. Everyone's path to understanding is different but we all benefit from reflecting on our mistakes. Since much of the mathematical content will build on previous ideas, however, reflecting in a timely way is important (hence a one-week deadline).  In addition to the regular in-class quizzes, you may re-assess any of the Learning Targets that we've covered through any either of the following methods:   On quiz days there is additional time to retake additional Learning Target quizzes.    You may schedule a retake on a particular Learning Target to be done during Help Hours in my office. This retake can be arranged to be done via conversation rather than written form.   The final exam will be used for additional Learning Target retakes. University policy requires that students take the final exam at the time determined by the registrar.     There are some restrictions on re-assessing using these methods:  Reassessments must be completed within 4 weeks of the first scheduled assessment.  A reassessment application must be submitted via email at least 24 hours in advance of the reassessment time.  Reassessment applications must include the name of the learning target and a copy of written corrections from the previous quiz.  You may not do more than one re-assessment per learning target outside of class per week.       Oral Exams  At any time, students may be requested to complete an oral exam to explain or clarify their written work on labs or proficiency assessments. Such oral exams can impact a students's grade on the given assessment.    Tokens  Tokens are an in-class currency designed to help you \"buy\" chances to improve your grade or relax a deadline, no questions asked. Everyone will start the semester with four tokens. There will be opportunities to earn additional tokens by engaging in consistent self-care and reflecting on it throughout the semester. Details will be posted on Moodle.     Action to Purchase Cost    Schedule a Proficiency Quiz retake an additional time in the same week 1 token    Resubmit a WebWork, Video Quiz or Lab assignment after the due date has passed 1 token    Exchange a token for 3 days of participation 1 token    Have another idea? Ask!       How your final grade is determined   Minimum requirements per grade    Final Grade A B C D    Proficiency (P, P+) in Core LTs  100% 100% 80% 65%    Proficiency across all LTs (as a % of those assessed)   90% 80% 70% 60%    % of P+ in LTs  75% 35% 0% 0%    Webwork, Video quiz, and participation  85% 70% 60% 50%    Proficient Labs (P, P+)  100% 100% 75% 50%     Note that these percentages are guidelines more than hard and fast rules. I will consider the entire body of your work when making these determinations, and this will also be informed by your own self-assessments. I will never impose standards higher than those outlined in the table but reserve the right to round down the needed minimum percentages (in a way that favors you).  Decisions about +\/- cutoffs will be based on (a) your performance on the final assessment and (b) your achievements as a whole.    Homework Champion  At mid-semester, students may apply to become Homework Champions. Those who wish to become a homework champion must submit the Homework Champion application no later than Wednesday after midsemester break at 5pm. The homework Champion application includes the following:   WebWork, video quiz, and participation average of 95% or better.    Score of proficient or highly proficient on all Learning Objectives.    A written reflection on your current study habits, the portions of the course that have been most beneficial to your learning, and the portions that have not been as beneficial to your learning.    A suggested contract for how you would like future Webwork, video quizzes, and participation to impact your grade. (For example, you may request not to have to complete video quizzes to prepare for class, and instead submit notes on the video viewing.)  I will review contract suggestions and update grading policy on your reflections.       Leveling Up  To qualify for additional reassessment opportunities, students can “level up”. This encourages students to get in the habit of reassessing early.   Level 1 All students begin the semester with the ability to retake each Learning Objective once per week, following reassessment protocol.   Level 2 After completing 5 retakes, students achieve Level 2. At Level 2 students can retake each Learning Objectives twice in a week.   Level 3 After completing 10 retakes, students achieve Level 3. At Level 3 students can retake each Learning Objectives past the four week barrier.     "

  "body": " Reminders and Expectations   Moodle  Consider Moodle your “base camp” for this course. All information, assignments, updates, Zoom links, etc. will be posted there. If you have a question, it's probably answered on Moodle (perhaps in this very syllabus...). I expect you to check the site frequently to stay on top of deadlines and course communications.    Classroom Climate  As someone who works hard to facilitate an environment that is safe and productive and that fosters inclusivity and deep belonging for each and every person in the room, I ask that you be courteous and respectful. I hope we can all learn to recognize individual differences as a source of strength and believe that each one of you is vital to the successful creation of a rich and diverse classroom space -- regardless of background, identity, or beliefs. Moreover, I contend that all perspectives are valuable (even those that are unpopular or that cause discomfort) because they are precisely what help broaden our understanding of the world and the people in it. As such, it is important that we approach one another with curiosity and kindness while trying to avoid judgement and bias. Please listen to others carefully, and thoughtfully consider ideas that are different from your own. Whatever your goals in life, you will be a better maker, builder, salesperson, colleague, leader, friend, and citizen if you are able to understand and accommodate a diverse range of perspectives! Also consider that mathematics is a robust and potentially persuasive analytic tool that can be used to challenge inherently inequitable systems of power and privilege. I treat it as such and want you to feel similarly empowered.  I expect our classroom to be a true community of learners, and anyone who acts in a negative, threatening, or disruptive way through their words or actions harms that community and inhibits the participation of others. Rude, mocking, obscene, hateful, racist, sexist, and all other forms of disrespectful speech have a negative impact on everyone's learning and will not be tolerated. If a person disrupts our class in any of these ways, I will address it and reserve the right to remove the disruptive person from the class. Moreover, if you witness a peer behaving in an objectionable way, I invite you to try to help them examine their actions with empathy and care. We will all make mistakes in the messy and complicated process of working together and must help one another be accountable for reflecting on how our impact may differ from our intent. When I make such a mistake, I hope you will hold me to the same high ideals and courageously help me examine my own impact. There will be a feedback form on our Moodle page in case you ever wish to report something to me (anonymously, if you prefer) that you find objectionable along any of the lines described above (e.g., behavior you experience as unwelcoming in any regard).    Getting Help  Don't hesitate to ask for assistance! I have help hours specifically in place because I want you to succeed, and the best place to connect with questions is one-on-one. If you can’t make it to my posted help hours, let me know and we can find another time. Other help options include:   Post your question to the class Moodle discussion board    Get together with classmates to study together    Drop by the Math Resource Center, which offers both drop-in and appointment-based tutoring.    Google it. If you find a resource helpful, let me know and you get a token!     I understand that life happens, and illness, depression, family, relationships can disrupt our lives. When something arises, REACH OUT! I want to be able to support you in this course, and can only do so if you let me know.    Rationale for Standards-Based Grading  While it may seem complicated, there are numerous reasons for adopting this type of grading scheme described above, all of which I firmly believe benefit you.   It is empowering and confidence-inspiring to know exactly what you have mastered-- and it's a more honest measure of what you've actually learned! No more random points grab.    It is built on the premise that deep understanding takes time and practice. Getting multiple chances to learn something favors the kind of persistence and intellectual resilience that is needed to succeed in learning (and everything else), and I want to prioritize that.    It gives you more agency and control over your ultimate grade. You get to decide whether to revise or challenge a quiz to boost your P\/P+ numbers, which topics to revisit, or whether to spend a token on an extension instead.    It replaces a few, high-stakes assessments (exams) with more numerous, low-stakes assessments, which decreases stress and pressure by spreading measurement out over the semester. It also makes your grade less susceptible to outlier events, such as when you feel sick on exam day.     If you'd like to read more about \"SBG\" check out Robert Talbert's blog, which articulates all this very nicely.   "

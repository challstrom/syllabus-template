  "body": " Welcome!    Prof. Hallstrom  University of Portland     Welcome!  For this course students will describe relationships between changing quantities using the tools of differential and integral calculus. The ideas of continuity, limits, differentiation, and integration are explored at both a theoretical level and in applied contexts. Students will further develop problem-solving skills and improve mathematical communication.  You Belong Here!  In our classroom, diversity and individual differences are respected, appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. I support the use of mathematics as an analytic tool to challenge power, privilege, and oppression. It is our collective responsibility to create a welcoming space where ideas can be challenged while individuals are respected. I ask you to support one another as you develop as mathematicians and analytic thinkers.   "

The Core Curriculum strives to achieve this vision by cultivating six habits of heart and mind in all graduates regardless of major.  As a priority for this Core class, our focus is the scientific and quantitative literacy and problem solving habit. As part of developing that habit this course will prioritize students learning to employ mathematical and statistical skills to explore and make sense of data. Toward this end, as one specific Core learning outcome for this class, the expectation is that students who complete this course will be able to use the tools of differential calculus to solve complex problems and effectively communicate solutions in written form.

Limits    (*) I can explain the meaning of a limit beyond describing how to calculuate it.  (*) I can find one and two sided limits of a functino at a point and at inifinity using numerical, graphical, and algebraic methods.  I can determine the points at which a function is (or is not) continuous and can use continuity to determine limits.  I can identify limits in indeterminate form and can apply L'Hopital's rule correctly.     Derivatives    (*) I can correcly interpret the meaning of a derivative as an instantaneous rate of change and compare it to an average rate of change both graphically and numerically.  I can find the derivative of a function (both at a point and as a function) using the limit definition of the derivative.  I can interpret teh meaning of a derivative and it's units in a variety of contexts.  (*) I can compute derivatives of polynomial and exponential functions.  (*) I can compute basic derivates using the product, quotient, and chain rules.  I can compute derivates of logarithmic, trigonometric, and inverse trig functions.  I can use techniques of implicit and logarithmic differentiation.  (*) I can compute derivates using combinations of multiple rules and strategies.     Applications    (*) I can find the equation of the tangent line to a graph of a function at a point. I can interpret the linear approximation graphically and use it to estimate function values and error.  (*) I can use information about a function and its derivatives to describe its behavior, including its concavity and the shape of its graph.  (*) I can use derivates to solve optimization problems.  I can use derivatives to solve related rate problems.     Integrals    I can calculate the area between curves, net change, and displacement using geometric methods, including Riemann sums.  I can use properities and theorems to calculate and interpret definte integrals.  (*) I can explain the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in terms of net change and displacements in graphical and applied contexts.  I can find antiderivates of a function and use them to evaluate definite integrals using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.     Connections    I can effectively communicate understand of course content using words, graphs, and notation.  I can demonstrate perseverance in solving complex and unfamiliar problems.  (*) I can evaluate the validity of statements and construct examples (or counterexamples) illustrating major concepts.  I can demonstrate a habit of consistent practice.  I can reflect on my own learning practices and use that reflection to grow as a learner.       "

The final exam will be used for additional Learning Target retakes. University policy requires that students take the final exam at the time determined by the registrar.     There are some restrictions on re-assessing using these methods:  Reassessments must be completed within 4 weeks of the first scheduled assessment.  A reassessment application must be submitted via email at least 24 hours in advance of the reassessment time.

I hope we can all learn to recognize individual differences as a source of strength and believe that each one of you is vital to the successful creation of a rich and diverse classroom space -- regardless of background, identity, or beliefs. Moreover, I contend that all perspectives are valuable (even those that are unpopular or that cause discomfort) because they are precisely what help broaden our understanding of the world and the people in it. As such, it is important that we approach one another with curiosity and kindness while trying to avoid judgement and bias. Please listen to others carefully, and thoughtfully consider ideas that are different from your own. Whatever your goals in life, you will be a better maker, builder, salesperson, colleague, leader, friend, and citizen if you are able to understand and accommodate a diverse range of perspectives! Also consider that mathematics is a robust and potentially persuasive analytic tool that can be used to challenge inherently inequitable systems of power and privilege. I treat it as such and want you to feel similarly empowered.  I expect our classroom to be a true community of learners, and anyone who acts in a negative, threatening, or disruptive way through their words or actions harms that community and inhibits the participation of others. Rude, mocking, obscene, hateful, racist, sexist, and all other forms of disrespectful speech have a negative impact on everyone's learning and will not be tolerated. If a person disrupts our class in any of these ways, I will address it and reserve the right to remove the disruptive person from the class. Moreover, if you witness a peer behaving in an objectionable way, I invite you to try to help them examine their actions with empathy and care. We will all make mistakes in the messy and complicated process of working together and must help one another be accountable for reflecting on how our impact may differ from our intent. When I make such a mistake, I hope you will hold me to the same high ideals and courageously help me examine my own impact. There will be a feedback form on our Moodle page in case you ever wish to report something to me (anonymously, if you prefer) that you find objectionable along any of the lines described above (e.g., behavior you experience as unwelcoming in any regard).

It is empowering and confidence-inspiring to know exactly what you have mastered-- and it's a more honest measure of what you've actually learned! No more random points grab.    It is built on the premise that deep understanding takes time and practice. Getting multiple chances to learn something favors the kind of persistence and intellectual resilience that is needed to succeed in learning (and everything else), and I want to prioritize that.    It gives you more agency and control over your ultimate grade. You get to decide whether to revise or challenge a quiz to boost your P\/P+ numbers, which topics to revisit, or whether to spend a token on an extension instead.    It replaces a few, high-stakes assessments (exams) with more numerous, low-stakes assessments, which decreases stress and pressure by spreading measurement out over the semester. It also makes your grade less susceptible to outlier events, such as when you feel sick on exam day.

Generally, students are expected to attend all class sessions according to the instructor’s direction. Students who feel unwell or have a temperature above 100 degrees should NOT attend class in person. These students should inform their instructor as soon as possible.  Students who must be in quarantine or isolation due to their own symptoms or exposure to someone with COVID-19 should also contact their instructor as soon as possible to work out details for keeping up with the course material remotely while in quarantine or isolation.  Please note, should the instructor test positive for COVID-19, even without symptoms, the course will be temporarily conducted remotely.

<div class="para">To create a successful in-person learning environment while keeping everyone safe, all students and instructors must follow the University’s COVID-19 rules and procedures that are in place at any given time during the semester for classrooms, labs, and all common areas of academic buildings. Such rules and procedures may include required face coverings, suggested distancing protocols and directions, and cleaning one’s desk space after usage, among other things. No food will be allowed in the classrooms or laboratories. Only water will be allowed in the classrooms but is not allowed in laboratories. If the University requires face coverings, they may only be removed temporarily when taking a drink of water. Failure to follow any of the COVID-19 classroom rules could result in a student’s removal from the course and/or a report filed with the Office of Student Conduct.</div>

<div class="para">I expect our classroom to be a true community of learners, and anyone who acts in a negative, threatening, or disruptive way through their words or actions harms that community and inhibits the participation of others. Rude, mocking, obscene, hateful, racist, sexist, and all other forms of disrespectful speech have a negative impact on everyoneâ€™s learning and will not be tolerated. If a person disrupts our class in any of these ways, I will address it and reserve the right to remove the disruptive person from the class.  Moreover, if you witness a peer behaving in an objectionable way, I invite you to try to help them examine their actions with empathy and care.  We will all make mistakes in the messy and complicated process of working together and must help one another be accountable for reflecting on how our impact may differ from our intent.  When I make such a mistake, I hope you will hold me to the same high ideals and courageously help me examine my own impact.  There will be a feedback form on our Moodle page in case you ever wish to report something to me (anonymously, if you prefer) that you find objectionable along any of the lines described above (e.g., behavior you experience as unwelcoming in any regard).</div>

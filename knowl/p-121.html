<div class="para">While it may seem complicated, there are numerous reasons for adopting this type of grading scheme described above, all of which I firmly believe benefit you.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">It is empowering and confidence-inspiring to know exactly what you have mastered-- and it’s a more honest measure of what you’ve actually learned!  No more random points grab.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">It is built on the premise that deep understanding takes time and practice.  Getting multiple chances to learn something favors the kind of persistence and intellectual resilience that is needed to succeed in learning (and everything else), and I want to prioritize that.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">It gives you more agency and control over your ultimate grade.  You get to decide whether to revise or challenge a quiz to boost your P/P+ numbers, which topics to revisit, or whether to spend a token on an extension instead.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">It replaces a few, high-stakes assessments (exams) with more numerous, low-stakes assessments, which decreases stress and pressure by spreading measurement out over the semester.  It also makes your grade less susceptible to outlier events, such as when you feel sick on exam day.</div></li>

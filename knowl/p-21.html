<div class="para">As a priority for this Core class, our focus is the “scientific and quantitative literacy and problem solving” habit. As part of developing that habit this course will prioritize students learning to employ mathematical and statistical skills to explore and make sense of data. Toward this end, as one specific Core learning outcome for this class, the expectation is that students who complete this course will be able to use the tools of differential calculus to solve complex problems and effectively communicate solutions in written form.</div>

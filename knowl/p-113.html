<div class="para">As someone who works hard to facilitate an environment that is safe and productive and that fosters inclusivity and deep belonging for each and every person in the room, I ask that you be courteous and respectful.  I hope we can all learn to recognize individual differences as a source of strength and believe that each one of you is vital to the successful creation of a rich and diverse classroom space -- regardless of background, identity, or beliefs.  Moreover, I contend that all perspectives are valuable (even those that are unpopular or that cause discomfort) because they are precisely what help broaden our understanding of the world and the people in it.  As such, it is important that we approach one another with curiosity and kindness while trying to avoid judgement and bias.  Please listen to others carefully, and thoughtfully consider ideas that are different from your own.  Whatever your goals in life, you will be a better maker, builder, salesperson, colleague, leader, friend, and citizen if you are able to understand and accommodate a diverse range of perspectives!  Also consider that mathematics is a robust and potentially persuasive analytic tool that can be used to challenge inherently inequitable systems of power and privilege. I treat it as such and want you to feel similarly empowered.</div>

<div class="para">As a college student, you may sometimes experience problems with your mental health that interfere with academic experiences and negatively impact daily life. If you or someone you know experiences mental health challenges at UP, please contact the University of Portland Health and Counseling Center in Orrico Hall (down the hill from Franz Hall and Mehling Hall) at <a class="external" href="http:www.up.edu/healthcenter" target="_blank">http:www.up.edu/healthcenter</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.5.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> or at 503-943-7134. Their services are free and confidential, and if necessary they can provide same day appointments. In addition, after-hours phone counseling is available if you call 503-943-7134 and press 3 outside of business hours. Also know that the University of Portland Public Safety Department (503-943-4444) has personnel trained to respond sensitively to mental health emergencies at all hours. Remember that getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do -- for yourself, for those you care about, and for those who care about you.</div>

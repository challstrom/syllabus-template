<div class="para">In this course you will describe relationships between changing quantities using the tools of differential and integral calculus and explore the ideas of continuity, limits, differentiation, and integration at both a theoretical level and in applied contexts. You will further develop problem-solving skills and improve mathematical communication.</div>

<div class="para">In our classroom, diversity and individual differences are respected, appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. I support the use of mathematics as an analytic tool to challenge power, privilege, and oppression. It is our collective responsibility to create a welcoming space where ideas can be challenged while individuals are respected. I ask you to support one another as you develop as mathematicians and analytic thinkers.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="frontmatter-1.html#assemblage-1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

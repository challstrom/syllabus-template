        <introduction>
          <p><em>Welcome!</em></p>
      
          <p> For this course students will describe relationships between changing quantities using the tools of differential and integral calculus. The ideas of continuity, limits, differentiation, and integration are explored at both a theoretical level and in applied contexts. Students will further develop problem-solving skills and improve mathematical communication.
          </p>
      
          <p><em>You Belong Here!</em></p>
          
          <p>In our classroom, diversity and individual differences are respected, appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. I support the use of mathematics as an analytic tool to challenge power, privilege, and oppression. It is our collective responsibility to create a welcoming space where ideas can be challenged while individuals are respected. I ask you to support one another as you develop as mathematicians and analytic thinkers.

      <title>Course Content and Objectives</title>
      <p>
        This course is an introduction to differential and integral calculus with an emphasis on applications in the natural and physical sciences. It is aimed at mathematics, engineering, and science majors or anyone else interested in building a foundation for further study in mathematics. Course-level learning goals include: communicating effectively about course content and solution methods; per- sistence in solving challenging, multi-step problems; reflection on one?s own learning; effective use of technology. Certain affective traits (i.e., dispositions and habits that are useful for all learners, regardless of topic) are also valued, such as persistence and growth mindset, and the development of these qualities will be fostered by the course.
      </p>
      
      <subsection xml:id="subsec-core">
  <title>University Core</title>
  <p>
    Calculus at the University of Portland is a part of our liberal arts 
    Core Curriculum with a vision of students acquiring knowledge, 
    skills, and values that will prepare you to respond to the needs of 
    the world and its human family, while having a foundation of 
    multiple lenses to address enduring questions of human concern. 
    The Core Curriculum strives to achieve this vision by 
    cultivating six habits of heart and mind in all graduates regardless 
    of major.
    </p>

    <p>
    As a priority for this Core class, our focus is the <q>scientific and 
    quantitative literacy and problem solving</q> habit. As part of 
    developing that habit this course will prioritize students learning 
    to employ mathematical and statistical skills to explore and make 
    sense of data. Toward this end, as one specific Core learning 
    outcome for this class, the expectation is that students who 
    complete this course will be able to use the tools of differential 
    calculus to solve complex problems and effectively communicate 
    solutions in written form.

<section xml:id="sec-assessment">
  <title>Methods of Assessment</title>
<p>This course is guided by the philosophy that learning mathematics requires focused effort, reflection, and revision. Assessment of this course is based on a proficiency system, in which students have multiple attempts to demonstrate proficiency, with opportunities to reflect on and improve previous understanding.</p>

      <subsection xml:id="subsec-participation">
        <title>Participation</title>
        <p>You are expected to actively participate in this classroom community. This can include coming to class on time, being prepared, being willing to ask questions and share ideas, setting up study groups outside of class, attending tutoring sessions, posting helpful resources online, and contributing to the classroom virtual chat. Exit cards will be assigned regularly at the conclusion of class as part of participation assessment. Group and individual presentations of ideas is a required component of participation.
        </p>
        <p>We will cover new course material on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Most Tuesday class times will be for small group work on labs and for proficiency assessment.
        </p>
      </subsection>

          
      <subsection xml:id="subsec-homework">
        <title>Homework</title>
        <p>Regular practice is required to convert new skills into lasting, automatic procedures. For most sections, you will be required to complete an online homework via WebWork. The online homework will be due at 5:00 pm. Homework is due Monday, Wednesday, or Friday the class period after it is covered in class. Homework is graded automatically. 
        </p>
        <p>It is strongly suggested that you do your homework regularly; it's best done following class, when it is fresh in your mind.  Most questions allow unlimited attempts and there is no penalty for incorrect answers. If you find yourself stuck on a problem after many attempts, please reach out for additional help! Late homework can earn up to half credit. 
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection xml:id="subsec-labs">
        <title>Labs</title>
        <p>Semi-weekly labs will be due on Wednesdays at 5pm. Lab problems should be either typed or written and submitted as a pdf file in Moodle. These labs are part of the Core Assessment, and will have common grading across all MTH 201 sections. Labs will be graded on three components:
          <dl>
            <li><title>Validity:</title>
              <p>Is the method correct?  Is the final solution correct? 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><title>Explanation:</title>
              <p>Is the solution method well explained? Is the reasonableness of the solution justified?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><title>Representation:</title>
              <p>Is the solution process clearly written? Is the solution supported with appropriate graphs/diagrams/equations? Is mathematical notation used clearly and correctly? 
              </p>
            </li>
          </dl>
        </p>
        <p>Labs are graded on a proficiency scale and revisions are due one week after the original due date.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection xml:id="subsec-vidquiz">
        <title>Video Quizzes</title>
        <p>Before each class, you will complete a 5-question, multiple-choice video quiz embedded in Moodle. You have two attempts and your highest attempt is recorded. To prepare for the video quiz, a 20 minute video Intro video is assigned for each section. An optional video with additional examples is posted for most sections as well. 
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection xml:id="subsec-profquiz">
        <title>Proficiency Quizzes</title>
        <p>Weekly proficiency quizzes provide opportunities to demonstrate your understanding of the course learning targets. Each quiz will include 2-3 learning targets as well as the option to reassess past targets. <alert>Proficiency should be attained twice for each learning target.</alert>
        </p>
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection xml:id="subsec-reflections">
        <title>Reflections</title>
        <p>Periodically throughout the semester I will ask you to think about your process and assess your progress in the course.  Reflections are a place to consider how things are going (and communicate that to me).  Self-assessments are an opportunity for you to connect the skills and proficiencies that you're practicing with the course-level objectives, as well as make the case that your progress in the course warrants a particular grade.

    <section xml:id="section-grades">
      <title>Assessment Standards</title> 
      
      <p>In general, your work in this class will be assessed using the following <em>Proficiency Scale</em>.
      </p>

          </row>
        </tabular>
    </p>

<subsection xml:id="section-revisit">
<title>Revisting Your Work</title>
<p>Much of your work in this class can be revised.  Everyone's path to understanding is different but we all benefit from reflecting on our mistakes.  Since much of the mathematical content will build on previous ideas, however, reflecting in a timely way is important (hence a one-week deadline).
</p>
<p>In addition to the regular in-class quizzes, you may re-assess any of the Learning Targets that we've covered through any either of the following methods:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On quiz days there is additional time to retake additional Learning Target quizzes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may schedule a retake on a particular Learning Target to be done during Help Hours in my office. This retake can be arranged to be done via conversation rather than written form.
    </p>
  </li>
<li><p>The final exam will be used for additional Learning Target retakes. University policy requires that students take the final exam at the time determined by the registrar.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>There are some restrictions on re-assessing using these methods:
  <ul>
    <li><p>Reassessments must be completed within 4 weeks of the first scheduled assessment.</p></li>
    <li><p>A reassessment application must be submitted via email at least 24 hours in advance of the reassessment time.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Reassessment applications must include the name of the learning target and a copy of written corrections from the previous quiz.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>You may not do more than one re-assessment per learning target outside of class per week.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</subsection>

<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-oralexam">
  <title>Oral Exams</title>
  <p>At any time, students may be requested to complete an oral exam to explain or clarify their written work on labs or proficiency assessments. Such oral exams can impact a students's grade on the given assessment.</p>
</subsubsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-tokens">
  <title>Tokens</title>
  <p>Tokens are an in-class currency designed to help you "buy" chances to improve your grade or relax a deadline, no questions asked.  Everyone will start the semester with four tokens. There will be opportunities to earn additional tokens by engaging in consistent self-care and reflecting on it throughout the semester.  Details will be posted on Moodle.</p>

        Note that these percentages are guidelines more than hard and fast rules. I will consider the entire body of your work when making these determinations, and this will also be informed by your own self-assessments.  I will never impose standards higher than those outlined in the table but reserve the right to round down the needed minimum percentages (in a way that favors you).
      </p>
      <p>
        Decisions about +/- cutoffs will be based on (a) your performance on the final assessment and (b) your achievements as a whole.

       Consider Moodle your “base camp” for this course.  All information, assignments, updates, Zoom links, etc. will be posted there.  If you have a question, it's probably answered on Moodle (perhaps in this very syllabus...).  I expect you to check the site frequently to stay on top of deadlines and course communications.

      <title>Classroom Climate</title>
      <p>
        As someone who works hard to facilitate an environment that is safe and productive and that fosters inclusivity and deep belonging for each and every person in the room, I ask that you be courteous and respectful.  I hope we can all learn to recognize individual differences as a source of strength and believe that each one of you is vital to the successful creation of a rich and diverse classroom space -- regardless of background, identity, or beliefs.  Moreover, I contend that all perspectives are valuable (even those that are unpopular or that cause discomfort) because they are precisely what help broaden our understanding of the world and the people in it.  As such, it is important that we approach one another with curiosity and kindness while trying to avoid judgement and bias.  Please listen to others carefully, and thoughtfully consider ideas that are different from your own.  Whatever your goals in life, you will be a better maker, builder, salesperson, colleague, leader, friend, and citizen if you are able to understand and accommodate a diverse range of perspectives!  Also consider that mathematics is a robust and potentially persuasive analytic tool that can be used to challenge inherently inequitable systems of power and privilege. I treat it as such and want you to feel similarly empowered.
      </p>
      <p>
        I expect our classroom to be a true community of learners, and anyone who acts in a negative, threatening, or disruptive way through their words or actions harms that community and inhibits the participation of others. Rude, mocking, obscene, hateful, racist, sexist, and all other forms of disrespectful speech have a negative impact on everyone's learning and will not be tolerated. If a person disrupts our class in any of these ways, I will address it and reserve the right to remove the disruptive person from the class.  Moreover, if you witness a peer behaving in an objectionable way, I invite you to try to help them examine their actions with empathy and care.  We will all make mistakes in the messy and complicated process of working together and must help one another be accountable for reflecting on how our impact may differ from our intent.  When I make such a mistake, I hope you will hold me to the same high ideals and courageously help me examine my own impact.  There will be a feedback form on our Moodle page in case you ever wish to report something to me (anonymously, if you prefer) that you find objectionable along any of the lines described above (e.g., behavior you experience as unwelcoming in any regard).

      <title>Rationale for Standards-Based Grading</title>
      <p>
        While it may seem complicated, there are numerous reasons for adopting this type of grading scheme described above, all of which I firmly believe benefit you.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>It is empowering and confidence-inspiring to know exactly what you have mastered-- and it's a more honest measure of what you've actually learned!  No more random points grab.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It is built on the premise that deep understanding takes time and practice.  Getting multiple chances to learn something favors the kind of persistence and intellectual resilience that is needed to succeed in learning (and everything else), and I want to prioritize that.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It gives you more agency and control over your ultimate grade.  You get to decide whether to revise or challenge a quiz to boost your P/P+ numbers, which topics to revisit, or whether to spend a token on an extension instead. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It replaces a few, high-stakes assessments (exams) with more numerous, low-stakes assessments, which decreases stress and pressure by spreading measurement out over the semester.  It also makes your grade less susceptible to outlier events, such as when you feel sick on exam day.
            </p>
          </li>

    <title>In-Person Learning During COVID-19</title>
    <p>
      To create a successful in-person learning environment while keeping everyone safe, all students and instructors must follow the University’s COVID-19 rules and procedures that are in place at any given time during the semester for classrooms, labs, and all common areas of academic buildings. Such rules and procedures may include required face coverings, suggested distancing protocols and directions, and cleaning one’s desk space after usage, among other things. No food will be allowed in the classrooms or laboratories. Only water will be allowed in the classrooms but is not allowed in laboratories. If the University requires face coverings, they may only be removed temporarily when taking a drink of water. Failure to follow any of the COVID-19 classroom rules could result in a student’s removal from the course and/or a report filed with the Office of Student Conduct.
    </p>

    <p>
      Generally, students are expected to attend all class sessions according to the instructor’s direction. Students who feel unwell or have a temperature above 100 degrees should NOT attend class in person. These students should inform their instructor as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students who must be in quarantine or isolation due to their own symptoms or exposure to someone with COVID-19 should also contact their instructor as soon as possible to work out details for keeping up with the course material remotely while in quarantine or isolation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note, should the instructor test positive for COVID-19, even without symptoms, the course will be temporarily conducted remotely. Should the instructor be unable to teach for an extended period of time, the respective department or unit will find a substitute to continue the course either in person or online.
